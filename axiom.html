 <center><h1> <font size="+2">Euclid's Axiom</font></h1></center>
 
 <p>In the Elements, Euclid attempted to bring together various geometric facts known at the time (including some he discovered himself) in order to form an axiomatic system in which these "facts" could be rigorously proven. Point, line, straight line, surface, and plane were among his undefined terms. (Because "line" meant any finite curve to Euclid, a "straight" line is what we would call a line segment.)</p>


<p> Euclid classified his axioms into two groups, naming the first five postulates and the following five "common notions." The distinction between postulates and common notions is that postulates are geometric in nature, whereas Euclid considered common notions to be true in general.</p>
<p>Euclid's axioms follows: <ol><li>It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any point.</li><li>It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line. (In modern terminology, this says that a line segment can be extended past either of its endpoints to form an arbitrarily large line segment.)</li><li>It is possible to create a circle with any center and distance (radius).</li><li>All right angles are equal to one another. (A right angle is, by Euclid's definition, "half" of a straight angle: that is, if a line segment has one of its endpoints on another line segment and divides the second segment into two angles that are equal to each other, the two equal angles are called right angles.)</li><li>If a straight line falling on (crossing) two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.</li><li>Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.</li><li>If equals are added to equals, the wholes (sums) are equal.</li><li>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders (differences) are equal.
</li><li>Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another.</li><li>The whole is greater than the part.</li></ol></p>
<p>All of the remaining geometric statements in the Elements were intended by Euclid to be logical consequences of these ten axioms.</p>
<p>In the two millennia since the first publication of the Elements, logical gaps in some of Euclid's arguments have been discovered, as have places where Euclid uses an assumption that he never explicitly states. Despite the fact that many of his arguments could be improved, the vast majority of his conclusions are sound.</p>
