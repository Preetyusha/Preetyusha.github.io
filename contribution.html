 <center><h1> <font size="+2">Euclid's Contribution</font></h1></center>
<p>Euclid's Elements, a collection of geometrical theorems, is his most important work and has become a part of mathematical history. Since its publication, Euclid's geometry has been included in mathematics textbooks. Euclid derived the theorems of what is now known as Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms in Euclid's Elements. Euclid's works on number theory, perspective, mathematical rigour, conic sections, number theory, and spherical geometry are among his contributions.</p>
<p> Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system developed by Euclid. Euclidean geometry is the study of solid figures and planes based on theorems and axioms. This is described in his geometry book, Euclid's Elements. Euclid's method entails accepting a small set of axioms and deducing a large number of other theorems from them.

An axiom is similar to an assumption. It is an accepted statement that serves as a starting point for further reasoning, logic, and arguments.

The majority of Euclid's results have already been expressed. Although Euclid was the first to collect, organise, and classify these propositions into a proper analytical system in which every result is proven from previously proven axioms and theorems. For a long time, Euclid's geometry was the only form of geometry available, and geometry only meant "Euclid's geometry" until mathematicians such as René Descartes introduced analytical geometry, which uses coordinates rather than axioms to express geometric concepts such as algebraic expressions. As a result, geometry is classified into two types: Euclidean geometry and analytical geometry.

The most common geometry taught in secondary schools is Euclidean geometry.</p>
