     <center><h1> <font size="+2">Euclid's Short Biography</font></h1></center>
<img src="euclid1.jpg" width="200" height="200"/> </center>
<p>Euclid is thought to have been born in the mid-fourth century BC in a town called Tyre, which is now in Lebanon. It is assumed that Euclid arrived in Alexandria, Egypt, around ten years after Alexander the Great, or around 322 BC.</p>
<p>Some of the historical references that have survived about Euclid are written by Proclus, a philosophical commentator who lived about eight centuries after Euclid. He confirmed the existence of Euclid as he briefly introduced the mathematician in his book “Commentary on the Elements”. Proclus also believed Euclid lived during the reign of Ptolemy I. Euclid is also referred to as "the author of the Elements" by Archimedes, a Greek mathematician and physicist.</p>
<p>Euclid died in Alexandria, Egypt, around 270 BC.</p>
